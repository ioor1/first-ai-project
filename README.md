# Project Title

First AI Project

## Summary

I have 0 (zero) ideas on what to make my project about, but hey - here I am. This is going to something alright, and it's probably going to be very mediocre. 


## Background

As part of all (read above) ideas I have for this project, I think the scope is that I need to figure out what to actually make. But I'll figure something out, soon.


## How is it used?

Very good question, you got more of those?



## Data sources and AI methods

No idea - I've been busy with work, so this was the least of my concerns these past weeks.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
It solves nothing! :D

## What next?

* Coming up with an idea what to do for this course.
* Drinking more coffee.
* Play RimWorld.
